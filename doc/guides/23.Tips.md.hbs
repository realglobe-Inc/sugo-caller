### Restricting Connecting Modules

Sometime you would like to make sure that the connecting actor has right modules as expected.

You can pass a JSON-Schema to `expect` option when accessing a modules.
If the modules does not conform to the schema, it throws an error.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-restrict.js'}}}
```


### Describing a Module

You can get module spec data via `.describe(moduleName)` of actor connection.

```javascript
{{{read 'example/example-describe.js'}}}
```
